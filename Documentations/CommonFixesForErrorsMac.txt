Common fixes for Errors created by compiling program.


   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   !! TRY MAKE CLEAN FIRST !!

   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


MAC:
-> Segmentation fault 11:
   1. Vector to long -> not a fix!
   2. write wrong to variable (for example to vector with [i] not push_back)
   3. wrong declaration in the constructor in the cpp file
      3.1 std::string don't like to be (NULL)

-> SDL_Mixer "error for object 0x...: pointer being freed was not allocated"
   1.

-> ...std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >) in ...
   ??? 1. When construct strings in the constructor use stringName("")

-> Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
   1. class/function typed different in different places

-> In file included from Source/.... .cpp:8: In file included from headerfile/ ...
   (-> unknown type Screen_Camera) (class-type)
   1. you included to many headers(-files)
   2. look when you included a class if there are 3 or more classes including each other -> not good ;)

LINUX:
-> Speicherzugriffsfehler (Speicherabzug geschrieben)
   1. printf richtige Verlinkung (%i oder %s überprüfen)
